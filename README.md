I started programming a computer universe based on voxels in February 2024 and I am trying to make it more complete. 
This project has an internal 3D rendering engine that was built by me using OpenGL called FA-Engine.

You can find more information about FA-Engine here: [FAE Repository](https://github.com/MatinAfzal/FloatArtsEngine)

Any programmer can use the codes in this project to build his own world or help improve ICU.
