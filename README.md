### 1. Introduction
OpenUniverse is a voxel-based computer world designed for collaboration and learning. This project offers a unique opportunity to explore programming concepts, optimize performance, and contribute to an open-source community.

While Python may not match the speed of C++ or Rust, we chose it for three key reasons:

1. **Challenging Optimization**: Implementing this project in Python presents unique optimization challenges that foster deeper learning experiences. Fewer programmers undertake similar projects in Python, making this an invaluable opportunity for growth.
  
2. **Enhanced Readability**: Python's readability makes it accessible for newcomers to programming. Projects like OpenUniverse can guide aspiring developers through complex concepts in a more digestible format.

3. **Philosophy of Programming**: The primary focus should be on understanding programming philosophy rather than just mastering a specific language. Engaging with this project encourages a broader perspective on engineering and design principles.

Any programmer can use the code within this project to build their own worlds or contribute to enhancing OpenUniverse. This project utilizes an internal engine called **FAE**, built from scratch specifically for OpenUniverse. More information about FA-Engine can be found [here](https://github.com/MatinAfzal/FloatArtsEngine).
