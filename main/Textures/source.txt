Provider:
    This is a 128 x 128 texture pack for Minetest that I made. Besides a big number of tiling textures of various materials (grass, dirt, snow, metals, stone, sand, ...) there are also item icons, tools, plants etc.
    It is all public domain, made with GIMP, largely as an original work, but also with reuse of other public domain resources. I also utilized neural style transfer to make photo textures look like hand painted. The list of third party sources can be found in the repository with the pack:
